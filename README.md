# Tetris_Engine
Tetris_Engine is a fully functional tetris game engine that I created in my spare time. I created this mainly to teach myself the basics of Python and game development. In working on this program, I reinforced my understanding of data structures such as 2d lists and dequeues. 


## Getting Started

Tetris_Engine is built to run using Python 3.7.2, but it should work on any machine with Python 3 or higher. Simply clone this repository to get a copy of the souce files.  
You can clone this project by running one of the following commands in the Linux console:  

HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/mwermert/Tetris_Engine.git`  

### Prerequisites

Tetris_Engine requires pygame version 1.9.6 and pylint version 2.2.2.

### Installing

Navigate to the project root directory and run the program from your terminal window or IDE (I am using VSCode).

### How to Play

When you run the program, the game will start immediately. In this game you have 4 control options.

1. The left arrow key will make your piece move to the left if possible.

2. The right arrow key will make your piece move to the right if possible.

3. The down arrow key will make your piece move down if possible.

4. The 'r' key rotates the piece 90 degrees to the right. The rotation pivot is the top left corner.

As the game continues, the speed at which the pieces fall increases. The rest of the game's rules are the same as every other game of Tetris.

## Using this Code

You are welcome to clone this code and use it if you would like to, but please make sure to credit me if you use it in any work.
